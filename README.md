# Erik - a calculator

This is a Week-Of-Learning project for me to learn the Rust programming language. I am 
following the same idea as when I first learned C# by writing a calculator program called 
[Eric](https://shawnhargreaves.com/eric). We shall see how far I am able to get creating 
a Rust version of that in just one week!

My Rust calculator is called Erik, because a rusty version of Eric can surely be nothing 
other than Erik the Red...
